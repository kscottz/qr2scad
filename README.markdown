qr2scad.py - Convert QR code images to OpenSCAD.

Installation / upgrade:

    sudo easy_install -U qr2scad

Dependencies:

* Python Imaging Library (PIL)

Use:

    qr2scad < qr_code.png > qr_code.scad

Why use this? If someone sees the QR code on your thing in real life, they can find the design and make their own copies with just a photo of it. Theoretically, you could even assign this job to a machine, looking around the web (or your tool box) for things that can be duplicated.
