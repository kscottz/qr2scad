qr2scad.py - Convert QR code images to OpenSCAD.

Installation: sudo easy_install qr2scad

Dependencies: Python Imaging Library (PIL)

Why use this? If someone sees the QR code on your thing in real life, they can find the design and make their own copies with just a photo of it. Theoretically, you could even assign this job to a machine, looking around the web (or your tool box) for things that can be duplicated.
